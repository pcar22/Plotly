## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to complete the dashboard that Roza needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Each volunteer can choose their ID number and indentify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
